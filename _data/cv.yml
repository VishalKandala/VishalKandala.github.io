      year: 2021 - Present
      description:
            - Conducted Literature review, understanding the codebase involved with the CURVIB method through implementation of benchmark problems such as channel flow but with moving boundaries, this was further extended with complicated patient specific aorta models and mesh.
            - Implemented basic incompressible flow solvers ( Artificial compressibility) parallely using PETSC and deployed on supercomputing clusters.

      description:
         - Through physical simulation and machine learning, a universal end-diastolic pressure volume relationship was found.
         - The relationship between measurable parameters (such as the slope and area under the end-diastolic pressure volume relationship curve) and myocardial stiffness has been examined using in-silico measurements.
