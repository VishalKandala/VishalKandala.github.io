I was invited to be a <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DiRwPtOftS8Qt4HHZq09UTHhhELHSM71/view?usp=sharing"> judge </a> for the senior division, Bio-Medical Engineering category at the  <a href = "https://txsef.tamu.edu/"> Texas Science & Engineering Fair </a> where I judged 10 projects in the senior division to select two teams to go on to the final round to win it all. I came across some very interesting projects that were multidisciplinary such as one involving Convolutional Neural Network based Malarial infection screening.
