In a Nature Scientific Reports Paper titled <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09128-6" >"A machine learning model to estimate myocardial stiffness from EDPVR" </a> from H.Babaei et.al, Vishal Kandala got an acknowledgement for providing a specific figure.

I was working with Dr.Reza Avaz at the <a href = "https://c2bl.engr.tamu.edu"> Computational Cardiovascular Biomechanics Lab </a> over the summer and Fall of 2021 on analysing the End-Diastolic Pressure Volume Relationship (EDPVR) for both LV and RV and the image used in the current work was produced as part of work related to that research which is currently in preparation to submit to the journal 'Computers in Biology and Medicine'
