I presented a poster titled <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Evrw7obWYqsgU0kJ-d7BjofmK-IDa0IO/view?usp=sharing">"High Performance Computing for Biofluids" </a> at the High Performance Computing Symposium conducted at Texas A&M University.

***
This poster presents an overview of how SCBL uses HPC to tackle challenging problems
such as Cardio-vascular Flows, Active Flow Control, Aquatic Locomotion etc. \
It underlines the fluid Structure Interaction simulation methodology and the CURVIB algorithm and demonstrates some of the recent results obtained at <a href = "https://scbl.engr.tamu.edu/"> SCBL </a>.
