Many a times, people find it difficult to reach the top cabinets in a kitchen due to their height and find it to be limiting and even confidence inhibiting, to overcome this, a simple mechanism is required that can be used to extend your reach while also ensuring user safety when raised higher than ground.

 - Raise the height of the user by 6”.
 - Stowable in kitchen Toe-kick area (3.5” Height when stocked).
 - Weigh less than 50 lbs.
 - Provide adequate foothold and be expandable. (11” width, 24”-48” length).
 - Non-corrosive, fire resistant, adhering to appropriate standards.
 - Durable, robust and easy to maintain.(Life span of ~3 years and 10,000 cycles)

Course Driven Requirements:
 - Shall have at least 12 non-trivial parts.
 - Shall include welded parts. 
 - Shall contain a dynamic mechanism.
